# tintoverlay

Tint overlay is a project that shows using SwiftUI how to add a background image and apply a gradient tint.

I'm going to take you on a journey about adding a gradient tint to a background image.  The journey will go through text modifiers with regular and semibold font weights, and font colour.  Using an image from Unsplash.  Adding a black tint, then transform it to a gradient using a colour array.
